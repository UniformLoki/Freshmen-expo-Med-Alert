Weight Sensor Test Results

Testing Procedure:
Connect sensor to Arduino
test 1: Read data from the sensor several times and see if it gives feedback to the serial monitor
test 2: Place a cup simulating a pill bottle on the sensor and see if it detects it
test 3: Place a single candy (like an m&m) simulating a pill on the sensor and see if it detects it
test 4: Place the cup on the sensor with several "pills" on it and see if it can recognize the difference in weight when one is removed


Flexiforce:
Outputs to serial monitor: Passed
Detects bottle: Failed
Detects pill: Failed
Detects pill removal: Failed

Straight Bar Load Cell
Outputs to serial monitor: Passed
Detects bottle: Passed
Detects pill: Passed
Detects pill removal: Passed

*Straight bar load cell was tested using code from the site below, not the weight sensor testing code on our repository
