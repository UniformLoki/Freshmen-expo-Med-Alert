Load Cell Calibration

The known masses of the followig objects were used to calibrate the load cell with the example code mentioned in the weight sensor testing file

according to https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Reese%27s_Pieces_91734200_nutritional_value.html
one reese's piece is about 0.8 g

Measured with kitchen scale
relay is 6 g
eraser is 23 g


calibration factor is 28510

The scale can measure a precision of about 100 mg or 0.1 g, but we may be able to get better results with a less wobbly setup
