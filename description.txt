Summary:
A system that sets off an alarm to remind people to take medications and can detect if they have been taken. There are two versions, the At-Home Edition and the Travel Edition. The At-Home Edition uses a weighted plate to detect if pills have been taken. The Travel Edition uses a contact sensor in the lid of the bottle to recognize if the bottle has been opened, but it canâ€™t detect if pills have been taken out.
Tasks:
-research sensors
-come up with design for the GUI
-SolidWorks model for travel edition
-make initial prototypes
-Documentation for weight pad
-research how to wirelessly transmit sensor data
-create a Medicine class the user can instantiate
-set up alarm/notification system
-class diagram?
-style guide
-make readme and .gitignore files
-set up streak feature
-write initial sensor reading code for each edition
-test prototype
-iterate designs
-repeat the last 2 steps until it works
-de-spaghetti code
GPIO:
The scale on the At-Home edition could be directly attached to an Arduino or the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi/Potato. For mobility, the Travel Edition would need to transmit sensor data wirelessly to the system running the GUI.
GUI:
The GUI would allow users to set up different schedules for each of their medications, calibrate sensors, and edit or dismiss alarms. It would also have a streak feature like Duolingo to assist with motivation.
